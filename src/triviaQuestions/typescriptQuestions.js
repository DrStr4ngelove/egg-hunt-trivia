    {
      question: 'What is TypeScript and what are its benefits over JavaScript?',
      answer: 'TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language. Its benefits include catching errors at compile time, better tooling support, and improved code maintainability.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What are interfaces in TypeScript and how do they differ from classes?',
      answer: 'Interfaces in TypeScript are used to define the structure of objects. They only describe the shape of an object and cannot have implementations. Classes, on the other hand, can have both structure and behavior.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the "any" type in TypeScript and when should it be used?',
      answer: 'The "any" type in TypeScript represents a value of any type. It can be used when the type of a value is unknown or when working with dynamic data.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What are generics in TypeScript?',
      answer: 'Generics in TypeScript allow you to create reusable components that can work with a variety of types. They enable you to define functions, classes, and interfaces that operate on any data type.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What are union types and intersection types in TypeScript?',
      answer: 'Union types in TypeScript allow a value to be of one of several types. Intersection types allow a value to have multiple types. Union types are denoted by the "|" symbol, while intersection types are denoted by the "&" symbol.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What is type inference in TypeScript?',
      answer: 'Type inference in TypeScript is the ability of the compiler to automatically determine the type of a variable based on its usage.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What are decorators in TypeScript and how are they used?',
      answer: 'Decorators in TypeScript are a way to add metadata to classes, methods, or properties. They are prefixed with the "@" symbol and can be used for various purposes such as logging, validation, and dependency injection.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What are access modifiers in TypeScript and what do they do?',
      answer: 'Keywords used to control the visibility and accessibility of class members. They include "public", "private", and "protected". "Public" members are accessible from outside the class, "private" members are only accessible within the class, and "protected" members are accessible within the class and its subclasses.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What is a namespace in TypeScript and when should it be used?',
      answer: 'Used to organize code into logical groups. It helps prevent naming conflicts and provides a way to encapsulate code.'
    },
    {
      question: "What are the three main 'simple types' in TypeScript?",
      answer: "Boolean, Number, and String"
  },
  {
      question: "______ is similar to 'any', but a safer alternative when uncertain about the type.",
      answer: "unknown"
  },
  {
      question: "________ an interface will have the same properties as that interface.",
      answer: "Extending"
  },
  ];
